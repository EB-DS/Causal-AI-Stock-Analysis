![Monte Carlo Simulation of Microsoft Stock Price (Next 1 Year)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42b5d912-ae67-43cf-bbe6-d56964dc4af1)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of **Causal AI techniques** in financial analysis to enhance decision-making, improve forecasting accuracy, and optimize investment strategies. The case study focuses on Microsoft's stock performance, integrating **Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis** to identify causal relationships between macroeconomic indicators and stock prices.

## Project Structure
The repository contains the following files:
- `Causal AI for Financial Decision-Making - Jupyter Notebook: The complete analysis including data collection, preprocessing, causal modeling, predictive analysis, and visualizations.
- `Medium Article : An accompanying article describing the methodology, findings, and practical implications of the study.

## Methodology
The analysis employs the following techniques:
- **Causal Inference Methods**: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), Do-calculus, and Counterfactual Analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Monte Carlo Simulations, DoWhy, and EconML for causal estimation and forecasting.
- **Data Sources**: Microsoft Stock Data, FRED Economic Indicators, IMF Outlook Reports, News Sentiment Analysis.

## Key Findings
- Identification of causal relationships between macroeconomic indicators and Microsoftâ€™s stock price.
- Enhanced forecasting accuracy through integration of causal inference and predictive modeling.
- Practical insights for investors on optimizing risk-adjusted returns.
